The genetic algorithm is a type of evolutionary algorithm that is inspired by the process of natural selection. In this project, the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal schedule for buses in a public transit system. The algorithm begins by creating an initial population of possible schedules, and then uses a fitness function to evaluate each schedule's performance. The fittest schedules are then selected for reproduction, and their offspring inherit some of their parents' traits. This process is repeated over many generations, gradually improving the quality of the schedules until an optimal solution is found.

The project includes several Python modules, each of which performs a specific function. The schedule_generator module creates the initial population of schedules, the fitness_evaluator module evaluates the fitness of each schedule, and the selection_operator module selects the fittest schedules for reproduction. The crossover_operator and mutation_operator modules perform the genetic operations of crossover and mutation on the selected schedules to produce their offspring.
